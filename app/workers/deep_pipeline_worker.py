"""Deep-learning pipeline worker (the "new" recognition path).

Runs the full AI pipeline in a QThread so the GUI stays responsive.  Two
modes exist, matching the two cards of the AI tab in Scan & Maintenance:

``rescan``
    Scans for new images, detects + embeds the new faces, removes duplicate
    overlapping boxes (a box assigned to a person always survives), retrains
    the neural network from every labeled face, then tries to place the
    still-unknown faces with the trained model.  Existing recognitions are
    never displaced.

``rebuild``
    Rebuilds the face database from scratch: every automatically detected
    box is deleted (manually drawn boxes and human-confirmed person
    assignments survive — they are the training data), every image is
    re-detected and re-embedded, then the same train + recognize flow runs.

``train``
    Embeds the missing faces, then retrains the model — nothing else.

``detect_faces``
    Analysis-only AI face detection over every image: stores where the
    pretrained deep-learning detector sees faces (bounding box + confidence)
    in the ``ai_face_detections`` table.  No Face row is created or changed.

``cluster``
    Lightweight rebuild of Unknown groups only: runs the permanently-ignored
    face filter, clusters all unassigned faces into new Unknown N persons,
    then runs the intra-image consistency pass and refreshes suggestions.
    No image scanning, no face detection, no model training.  Use this after
    an Unknown persons reset to rebuild the groups from existing face data.

Accuracy is preferred over speed throughout: training may take minutes and
is allowed to saturate every CPU core.
